# Ethical Sourcing Strategy – Nestlé Cocoa Supply Chain (West Africa)

This project outlines a global sourcing and stakeholder engagement strategy for **Nestlé**, with a focus on ethically transforming its cocoa supply chain in **Ghana** and **Côte d’Ivoire**. It addresses operational, cultural, and regulatory challenges in eliminating child labor and aligning global standards with local realities.

##  Objective

To help Nestlé meet its goal of **eliminating child labor by 2025** through:
- Culturally sensitive implementation of global policies
- Transparent cocoa sourcing using tech solutions
- Inclusive stakeholder partnerships with farmers, NGOs, and local leaders

---

##  Key Strategic Challenges

- **Cultural mismatch**: Top-down KPIs vs local norms
- **Lack of localization**: Inappropriate metric systems

##  Frameworks Applied

- **Kotter’s 8-Step Change Management**
- **Triple Bottom Line (People, Planet, Profit)**
- **Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions**
- **Stakeholder Theory**

## Strategic Solutions Proposed

1. **Local Stakeholder Council**: Involving farmers, NGOs, and Nestlé reps in sourcing decisions
2. **CLMRS Expansion**: Scalable monitoring/remediation system for child labor
3. **Tech Integration**: GPS + Blockchain for transparent farm-to-bar traceability
4. **Cultural Calibration**: Local KPI adaptation, peer-led communication, and farmer trust-building
5. **Feedback Loops**: For continuous improvement from the field to HQ
